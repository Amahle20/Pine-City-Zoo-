        <p>Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Two species are traditionally recognised: the African elephant (<i>Loxodonta africana</i>) and the Asian elephant (<i>Elephas maximus</i>).</p>

        <p>Male African elephants are the largest land animals and can reach 4 meters in height and weigh up to 7,000 kg.</p>

        <p>They are known for their trunks, which are used for breathing, grabbing objects, and lifting water. Their tusks are used for digging and as weapons. African elephants have larger ears than Asian elephants, which help regulate body temperature.</p>

        <p>They live in various environments such as forests, savannahs, and marshes â€” but always near water.</p>
